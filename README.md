## Core Technology
Our software utilizes advanced language models to analyze and recommend outfits based on user-uploaded photos. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:

1. **Image Analysis**: When a user uploads a photo of a clothing item, the image is processed using computer vision techniques to extract features such as color, texture, and style.

2. **Feature Extraction**: The extracted features are fed into a pre-trained language model which has been fine-tuned on fashion-related data. This model understands the context and style of the clothing item.

3. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on the analyzed features, the language model suggests matching clothing items. The recommendations are generated by considering fashion trends, user preferences, and compatibility of styles.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Users can provide feedback on the recommendations, which is used to fine-tune the model and improve future suggestions.
